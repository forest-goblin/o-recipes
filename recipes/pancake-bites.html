<h2>Recipe Description</h2>
<p>These Blueberry Pancake Bites are super simple and perfect for on the go breakfasts. A bite sized pancake bite loaded with blueberries (or whichever mix-in your prefer). Place them in a cup and send the kiddos off to school with a <strong>warm, easy</strong> and <strong>tasty </strong>breakfast. 
</p>

<p>We whipped up a batch of these Pancake Bites in no time. I made a few batches after everybody gave their approval. I wanted extras to toss in the freezer for the kiddos to have for <em>quick</em> and <em>easy</em> breakfast on school days. I decided to make some small baggies of icing too. Perfect to microwave before heading out.
